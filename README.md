# jQuery promises demo

A demonstration of jQuery promises.

Requires Node and Node Express.

Test 1 is a successful test where the correct key is returned after 3 seconds allowing further actions to use the key.

Test 2 does not return the correct key after 1 second, this prevents further actions.

This demonstration creates a single Node server with two ports for Express and Interfake. Requests are made using a query string only for this demostration.
